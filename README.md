## Project Description:

This project focuses on controlling a 6DOF robot arm in MATLAB using forward and inverse kinematics. The following steps were undertaken to achieve the desired outcome:

### [Design:](link:"SW_PARTS_and_ASSEMPLY") 
The robot arm was designed in SolidWorks, with the chosen model being ABB_IRB_1200. All the SolidWorks files, including the parts and assembly, can be found in the "SW_PARTS_and_ASSEMBLY" folder.

### Integration: 
After completing the design, the 3D model was imported into MATLAB for further processing and control.

### Kinematics Codes:
Two MATLAB codes were developed—one for forward kinematics and the other for inverse kinematics—to enable precise control of the robot arm.

### Implementation: 
The necessary blocks were connected within MATLAB, allowing for the practical control of the robot arm.

The project documentation and source code are available in this GitHub repository. Feel free to explore the files, diagrams, and codes to understand the project in more detail.

Note: It's interesting how a project that takes days or even weeks to complete can be summarized in a brief description. Nonetheless, this description provides an overview of the project's objectives and key steps undertaken.
