# Just a simple describtion :)
- this is a broject to control 6dof robot arm in matlab using forward and inverse 
  	 kinematics 
# The Process :(
1 - I have designed the a 6dof robot arm in solidworks and I've choosen ABB_IRB_1200 model
    	.You can find all files of solid in file called "SW_PARTS_and_ASSEMPLy", I think that
     	was very clear and explain himself :)
      
2 - I imported the 3d model into matlap after I finished it.

3 - I made two matlap code one for forward kinematics and the other for inverse to control my 
     	robot.
      
4 - I connected all my blocks and began to control it.

# DON'T READ 
Did you know that itâ€™s funny that it takes you several days and a lot of effort to finish your project and then you come and summarize it in a few minutes?
