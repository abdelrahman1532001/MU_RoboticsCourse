# Just a simple description :)

This is a project to control a 6DOF robot arm in MATLAB using forward and inverse kinematics.

# The Process:

1. I designed a 6DOF robot arm in SolidWorks, using the ABB_IRB_1200 model. You can find all the SolidWorks files in a folder called "SW_PARTS_and_ASSEMBLY." I believe the design is clear and self-explanatory.

2. After finishing the design, I imported the 3D model into MATLAB.

3. I created two MATLAB codes, one for forward kinematics and the other for inverse kinematics, to control the robot.

4. I connected all the necessary blocks and started controlling the robot.
