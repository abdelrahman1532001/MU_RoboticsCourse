## Project Description:

This project focuses on controlling a 6DOF robot arm in MATLAB using forward and inverse kinematics. The following steps were undertaken to achieve the desired outcome:

### üé® Design:
The robot arm was designed in SolidWorks, with the chosen model being ABB_IRB_1200. All the SolidWorks files, including the parts and assembly, can be found in the ["SW_PARTS_and_ASSEMBLY" folder](https://github.com/abdelrahman1532001/MU_RoboticsCourse/tree/main/SW_PARTS_and_ASSEMPLY). Take a closer look at the intricate design and components of the robot arm!

### üõ† Integration:
After completing the design, the 3D model was seamlessly integrated into MATLAB for further processing and control. Experience the seamless integration of hardware and software!

### üíª Kinematics Codes:
Unlock precise control of the robot arm with two dedicated MATLAB codes‚Äîone for forward kinematics and the other for inverse kinematics. Dive into the code and explore the algorithms that enable accurate motion planning!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation:
Witness the culmination of design, integration, and coding as all the necessary blocks come together within MATLAB, empowering practical control of the robot arm. Get hands-on with the implementation of the project!
